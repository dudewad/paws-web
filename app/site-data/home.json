We are dedicated to improving the dog-based community by offering free training courses to our members, networking with local dog rescue agencies to bring deserving dogs to deserving owners, and serve PNW beers, ciders, kombucha and wine. At Paws For a Beer, whether the dogs are on the couches or cruising around behind the bar, it's all good. Because this is all for them.",
